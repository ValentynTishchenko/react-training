All tasks should be implemented in two ways with class components and functional components

- implement timer that will be able to display time and will have next functionality:
    - stopping
    - resetting
    - continuing
- create application that allows to increase and decrease a counter value (display this value), step of increasing and decreasing should be able to be edited via input
- display list of posts fetched from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/, handle loading\error states, implement refresh button and ability to search by userId
- implement a task board with next functionality:
    - ability to add and name columns (remove as well)
    - ability to add todos to each column (remove as well)
    - ability to update a todo name;
    - ability to move todos between columns (via click on buttons, no need to implement drag and drops, but it is not restricted)
